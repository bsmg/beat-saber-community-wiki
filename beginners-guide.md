# How to install mods

Beat Saber was not designed with mod support, so you have to run the Mod Manager below to enable mods.

## Beat Saber Mod Manager

* Navigate to https://github.com/Umbranoxio/BeatSaberModInstaller/releases
* Download the BeatSaberModManager.exe
* Run it! Select what mods you want to install from the list!

Mods are installed into the folder `Plugins` within your Beat Saber install directory.

# How to get more songs
The Mod Manager includes the `Ingame Downloader Plugin`, which allows you to download beatmaps in the game using the `BEATSAVER` menu button on the main menu screen. This pulls beatmaps directly from www.beatsaver.com
You can also manually place beatmaps into the `CustomSongs` folder in your Beat Saber directory. See [install folder](FAQ/install-folder).

# How to uninstall mods
**Currently the only way to uninstall a mod is to remove the dll from the `Plugins` folder.**
