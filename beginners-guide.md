# How to Install Mods

Follow these instructions to get mods working in Beat Saber! 

## Beat Saber Mod Manager

* Navigate to https://github.com/Umbranoxio/BeatSaberModInstaller/releases
* Download the BeatSaberModManager.exe
* Run it! Select what mods you want to install from the list!

Mods are installed into the folder `Plugins` within your Beat Saber install directory.

Note:
**After a game update, run the game once before installing any mods, close the game, then use the mod manager.**

Since each update breaks old plugins, the game moves all files in any existing `Plugins` folder into an `Incompatible Plugins` folder when Beat Saber is launched for the first time after an update. This saves everyone the trouble of digging through the files to find outdated mods that are breaking the new ones. 

This also happens on fresh installs with brand new plugins.
