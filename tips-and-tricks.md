# Improve VIVE controller tracking
Your body may be blocking one lighthouse from seeing one of your controllers.
1. Move into the corner of your playspace.
1. Rotate your body 45 degrees so that your lighthouses can see both controllers. 
1. Rotating the room within Beat Saber's settings to compensate for your rotation.
