<!-- TITLE: Custom Avatars -->
# Installing
The latest Custom Avatar plugin can be found in this [Github](https://github.com/xyonico/CustomAvatarsPlugin/releases/latest).
Download the zip file called `CustomAvatarsPlugin`, and extract it into [your install folder](/FAQ/install-folder). 
Once installed you should see a file called `CustomAvatar.dll` inside your `Plugins` folder. You should also see a folder called `CustomAvatars` in the main install folder, this is where you will be placing the `*.avatar` files you want to use. 

# Usage
The plugin uses the keyboard to change the settings. Make sure you have the game focused.

Note: Some avatars were not made with first person view in mind, so they might block your vision if enabled.
# Creating your own avatar
[Assistant's Avatar Guide](https://bs.assistant.moe/Avatars) is a good resource for learning how to make your own avatar.
The guide includes a [short video narrated by Megalon](https://bs.assistant.moe/Avatars#Videos), however it is not as in depth and you should watch it in addition to reading the guide, not instead of.
