# Using dnSpy
dnSpy is a ".NET debugger and assembly editor".
You can use it to view the games compiled code translated back into C#!
Read more about it [here](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy).

Download the [latest release of dnSpy.zip](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy/releases/latest).
Extract the zip, and run `dnSpy.exe`.
Then drop in the file `\<Beat Saber Directory>\Beat Saber_Data\Managed\Assembly-CSharp.dll`
`Assembly-CSharp.dll` contains nearly all of the games' code.
