# Installing Mods

To install other mods that you have downloaded or made, place the plugin into your `Plugins` folder within the Beat Saber install directory.

# Making Mods
Beat Saber does not have built in mod support.
Instead, all mods within the mod installer rely on IPA (Illusion Plugin Architecture) to inject plugins into the game.
