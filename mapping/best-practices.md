# Best Practices for Block Placement

This guide is intended to comprise of common mistakes seen in custom maps, and will be updated continuously. To get started with custom beatmaps, visit [mapping reference](mapping). If you have any questions or comments about this guide, feel free to DM me on Discord @Awfulnaut.

**GOLDEN RULE:** Rigorously playtest your chart before publishing to [beatsaver](https://beatsaver.com/)! Get feedback from other players and mappers! Just because it feels right to you doesn’t mean it plays well for others. If other people say it doesn’t feel right, listen to their advice and make tweaks. DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP!

Don't do this | Explanation / Solution
-------------- | --------------
Vision Blocks | Vision blocks: 95% of the time, you should not place blocks in the middle two sections of the grid. This is eye level and makes seeing blocks behind them nearly impossible. Instead, place blocks elsewhere (usually on the bottom row).

Exception: For the other 5% of the time, a good rule of thumb is to make sure the player is pushed to the side—either by barriers or by the pattern itself—or put it at the very end of a pattern so there is a calm spot after it. Always keep visibility in mind.

Protip: Don’t be afraid to put blocks in the bottom corners.
