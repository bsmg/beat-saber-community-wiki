## RangeValley
My dad worked for years as an admin, but he got laid off when bots took over. He came home that night and told me we had to move into the van, since we couldn't afford rent anymore, then he beat the shit out of me with jumper cables. Shitposting should be legal.

# Staff
The team that runs the show at the forefront and behind the scenes. Whether it comes to project management, plugin approval, paying for the servers (RIP our wallets), event coordination, or many of the other secret projects, there's always lots of work to be done! The community wouldn't be around without the countless hours contributed by these incredible individuals, so please give them a virtual round of applause!

# Mappers
Each of your favorite maps is carefully crafted and tested over many hours by a talented mapper. As much as we'd love to include them here too, there are WAY too many of them. If you like someone's maps, give it a thumbs up in game, review it on [BeastSaber](https://bsaber.com), or tell them personally! They'll really appreciate it. If you ever want to commission a map, we encourage you to contact them outside of the server as well.
